Eat Da Burger! 🍔
Built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
🍔🍔🍔
## How it works:
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the
 left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user
 clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
